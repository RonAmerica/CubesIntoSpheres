These are some programs to demonstrate changing a cube into a sphere.
The resulting sphere is more efficient than spheres that are made by other means.

A couple of the programs also demonstrate 3D graphics without using 3D graphics library functions.
The non-OpenGL programs are using atan2 to calculate the X and Y coordinates on the screen of points in 3D space.

These are coded by W R Spain Jr.
